The MUSSLES group consists of three undergraduate students (John Letey, Mingxuan Zhang, and Nihar Nandan) and one instructor (Tony Wong). Our roles are:

- John Letey is exploring the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo statistical calibration methods to fit distributions to data, including estimation of distributions for storm surge return levels.
- Mingxuan Zhang is exploring the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo statistical calibration methods to constrain estimates of storm surge return levels.
- Nihar Nandan is investigating the impacts of uncertainty characterization/quantification in statistical calibration framework, on projections for future temperature and sea levels.
